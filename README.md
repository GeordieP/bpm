# BPM Tapper ü•Å‚å®Ô∏è

BPM Tapper is a simple project that allows you to calculate the Beats Presses Per Minute (BPM) by tapping on your keyboard or clicking your mouse.

## Usage

You can access the BPM Tapper project at https://bpm.vercel.app/. Once you're on the page, follow these steps:

1. Press any key on your keyboard or click your mouse to start tapping.
2. Continue tapping for a few seconds.
3. Once you're done tapping, the BPM Tapper will display the BPM calculated based on your tapping.

## Example

Let's say you want to measure how fast you can press a key on your keyboard or you can click your mouse:

1. Go to https://bpm.vercel.app/
2. Press any key on your keyboard or click on your mouse to start tapping.
3. Once you're done tapping, the BPM Tapper will display the BPM calculated based on your tapping.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need to quickly measure the BPM of a button press or mouse click without having to download any software or use complex tools.
