# BPM Tapper ü•Å‚å®Ô∏è

BPM Tapper is a simple project that allows you to calculate the Button Presses Per Minute (BPM) by tapping on your keyboard.

## Usage

You can access the BPM Tapper project at https://bpm.vercel.app/. Once you're on the page, follow these steps:

1. Press any key on your keyboard to start tapping.
2. Continue tapping the key for a few seconds.
3. Once you're done tapping, the BPM Tapper will display the Button Presses Per Minute (BPM) calculated based on your tapping.

## Example

Let's say you want to measure how fast you can press a key on your keyboard:

1. Go to https://bpm.vercel.app/
2. Press any key on your keyboard to start tapping.
3. Once you're done tapping, the BPM Tapper will display the Button Presses Per Minute (BPM) calculated based on your tapping.

## Acknowledgments

This project was inspired by the need to quickly measure the BPM of a button press without having to download any software or use complex tools.
